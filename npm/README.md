## Quick Start

[Get started with the Quick Start Guide](https://docs.apiverve.com/quickstart?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=readme)

The TOTP Generator API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/totpgenerator](https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/totpgenerator?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=readme).
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

const api = new totpgeneratorAPI({
    api_key: '[YOUR_API_KEY]'
});
```

## Usage

---

### Perform Request

Using the API is simple. All you have to do is make a request. The API will return a response with the data you requested.

```javascript
var query = {
  "secret": "JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP",
  "digits": 6,
  "period": 30
};

api.execute(query, function (error, data) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

---

### Using Promises

You can also use promises to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
var query = {
  "secret": "JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP",
  "digits": 6,
  "period": 30
};

api.execute(query)
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

---

### Using Async/Await

You can also use async/await to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
async function makeRequest() {
    var query = {
  "secret": "JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP",
  "digits": 6,
  "period": 30
};

    try {
        const data = await api.execute(query);
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```

---

## Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "error": null,
  "data": {
    "token": "889707",
    "digits": 6,
    "period": 30,
    "timeRemaining": 22,
    "expiresAt": "2025-11-19T21:25:30Z"
  }
}
```
